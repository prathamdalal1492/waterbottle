      <h4>Trash. All humans have different Opinions on a series of topics, but 
      it can be Unanimous that all of us create Trash. However not all of us 
      dispose of it correctly, and that can lead to significant environmental 
      hazards. A major pollutant is water bottles, which if left in place release
      up to 13.2 pounds of Carbon Dioxide. Our group tried to find a way to 
      encourage people to recycle more. In a survey of High School Students we 
      discovered 37% of students do not know that if you recycle a water bottle
      you are compensated $0.05. Our goal was to use this key data point to come 
      up with an efficent solution.

      <h4>High Schoolers are desperate for money, there is a reason high school 
      summer jobs are so desirable. they are an instantaneous way to make money.
      Our group created a better way to make money. We created an Automatic 
      Water Bottle recycler that dispenses money on the spot. We believe this 
      would encourage additional people to recycle. In a survey of High School 
      Student 86% reported they would dispose of water bottles correctly if they
      were to get some form of compensation.  Water Bottles will now be off the 
      street and high schoolers will be happy. </h4>
